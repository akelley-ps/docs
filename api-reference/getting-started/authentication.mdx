description: Learn how to authenticate with our REST API using Bearer tokens
---

Our REST API uses Bearer token authentication to secure API endpoints. This guide will help you understand how to authenticate your requests.

## Overview

Bearer authentication is a simple and secure way to authenticate API requests. You'll need to include a valid access token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

## Getting Your Access Token

### 1. Create an Account

First, you'll need to create an account on our platform. Visit the [signup page](https://example.com/signup) to get started.

### 2. Generate an API Key

Once you have an account:

1. Navigate to your [API Keys dashboard](https://example.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create New API Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again)

**Important**: Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. Treat it like a password.

## Using Bearer Authentication

### HTTP Header Format

Include your access token in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Example Requests

#### cURL

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### JavaScript (fetch)

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/users', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

#### Python (requests)

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/users', headers=headers)
data = response.json()
```

#### Node.js (axios)

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/v1/users', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = response.data;
```

## Token Scopes and Permissions

Your access token may have different scopes that determine what actions you can perform:

- **read**: Read-only access to resources
- **write**: Create and update resources
- **delete**: Delete resources
- **admin**: Full administrative access

Check your token's scopes in your [API Keys dashboard](https://example.com/api-keys).

## Error Responses

### Invalid Token (401 Unauthorized)

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_token",
  "error_description": "The access token is invalid or expired",
  "status_code": 401
}
```

### Missing Token (401 Unauthorized)

```json
{
  "error": "missing_token",
  "error_description": "Authorization header is required",
  "status_code": 401
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions (403 Forbidden)

```json
{
  "error": "insufficient_permissions",
  "error_description": "Your token doesn't have the required permissions for this action",
  "status_code": 403
}
```

## Token Expiration

Access tokens have a limited lifespan for security reasons:

- **Default expiration**: 30 days
- **Maximum expiration**: 90 days
- **Refresh tokens**: Available for automatic renewal

When your token expires, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. You'll need to generate a new token from your dashboard.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep tokens secure**: Never commit tokens to version control or share them publicly
2. **Use environment variables**: Store tokens in environment variables or secure configuration files
3. **Rotate tokens regularly**: Generate new tokens periodically and revoke old ones
4. **Use HTTPS**: Always make API requests over HTTPS
5. **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your API usage and token activity

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your plan. For detailed information about rate limits, headers, and best practices, see our [Rate Limits guide](/rest-api/getting-started/rate-limits).

## Getting Help

If you're having trouble with authentication:

1. Check that your token is valid and not expired
2. Verify you're using the correct Authorization header format
3. Ensure your token has the necessary permissions
4. Review our [API documentation](/rest-api) for endpoint-specific requirements
5. Contact [support](mailto:support@example.com) if you need additional help
